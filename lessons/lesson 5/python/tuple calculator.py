numbers = (2, 3, 4, 5)

product = 1

for num in numbers:
    product *= num

print("The product of all numbers in the tuple is:", product)
✔ How it works:
Start with product = 1

Loop through each element in the tuple

Multiply each element with product

Print the final result

Example Output:
python
Copy code
The product of all numbers in the tuple is: 120
If you want, I can also provide a version using math.prod() or ask the user for input.
